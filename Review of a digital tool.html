Microsoft Word or Google Docs?
</h1>
    
 <p class="indent">      
 Microsoft Word is a word processing software that was developed by Microsoft and launched well before other similar word processing softwares like Google Docs. Although I have found that Google Docs provides users with a more simplified interface as well as ease of access on mobile devices, I tend to use Microsoft Word much more frequently for scholarly purposes and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for an all-inclusive platform that they can use for a variety of purposes.

In elementary school, Microsoft Word was the default application that was downloaded on my siblings’ Windows computer that I often used to either play games on but infrequently used to type a writing assignment. I found that the tools to change the font, color, or style of my text were expansive and really allowed me to experiment with my creative abilities. This was, however, before I was told that formal pieces of writing are to be submitted in Black ink, font size 12, and Times New Roman. In middle school, I was introduced to Google Docs which I found to be quite useful, because I already had a Gmail account that my Google Docs account and Google Drive were linked to. I found that I was able to do everything that I did before on Microsoft Word but on a more simplified platform with all the features that I would need to write essays and research papers. Although Google Docs has most of the font style features that Microsoft Word has, one feature in particular that is much easier on Microsoft Word is the strikethrough feature. There are keyboard shortcuts that you can use for the strikethrough feature on Google Docs, but I find that trying to remember keyboard shortcuts for simple things that can be added as features in the toolbar makes things complicated. On the other hand, Microsoft Word has the strikethrough feature to the right of the underline feature; for someone that is using both platforms for the first time, seeing the strikethrough feature in the toolbar rather than trying to find it elsewhere or using a keyboard shortcut makes the writing experience less stressful and less complicated. Hence, I think that Microsoft Word’s interface provides users with more convenience and optionality.

As a college student now at Northeastern University, I find that since I use Outlook and other Microsoft Office programs, using Microsoft Word is much more convenient for me as well as a lot of the people I work with even though I have my personal Gmail account and Google Docs associated with it. This is especially true when it comes to collaborating with others on different long-term projects that require us to use multiple platforms including Teams, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Excel. This is when using Microsoft Word is especially helpful, because we are able to keep a shared copy of every document in Teams for everyone to access the most up-to-date version at any time. Although Google Drive has very similar functionality to Teams in regards to organizing files, the missing element that Teams provides users with is the Chat feature that can be used for short conversations to save time that would otherwise be spent sending emails for quick questions or concerns.

I have also come to learn that Microsoft Word has more expansive abilities and features when it comes to creating figures, diagrams, or other types of exhibits. For my International Business and Supply Chain cases, I chose to use Microsoft Word over Google Docs for this very reason. Microsoft Word has more functions to create and modify graphs and figures. Although Google Docs is more convenient for quick note-taking on a mobile device, I find that Microsoft Word offers users with more stylistic features, making it much more useful to use for scholarly purposes.
