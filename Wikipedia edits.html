Reflection on the Wikpedia Editing Experience
</h1>
    
<p class="indent">
Using Wikipedia for this assignment was an interesting experience and was a bit more technical than I had initially expected. I was only vaguely familiar with the Visual Editing feature before and did not know about the Source Editor until we went over it in class. I think that for someone that has been a long-time Wikipedia editor, it wouldn’t be as apparent that using the Source Editor in Wikipedia takes one some time to get used to and understand all its text and style editing features unless they are already familiar with the programming language HTML or other forms of coding. It took me some time to go through and fully understand the code used in previous comments by Wikipedia editors in the Source Editor section. However, I will say that learning the basics of editing on Wikipedia for rudimentary purposes was not too difficult. In terms of “knowing” Wikipedia now, I will say that to some degree we have all known the basic uses of Wikipedia and the basic content that it can provide on a certain topic, but this exercise and the discussions we have had in class have helped me develop a deeper understanding of why it is that teachers and professors advise students to use other sources for academic research and scholarly purposes. The fact that there are Wikipedia pages that have been nominated for deletion and have been further discussed by other Wikipedia editors, who could be anyone from a regular Wikipedia editor to someone that is very unfamiliar with editing on Wikipedia, suggests that content that is kept on Wikipedia or has not been yet questioned could very well be nominated for deletion in the future. Although the community has set a number of standards that a Wikipedia article must meet as well as established content and areas that are not intended to be included in Wikipedia articles, the number of standards by which articles are reviewed are numerous and allow for some subjectivity in the process of review. Hence, I feel that Wikipedia can only be used for a general understanding of certain topics and that if one uses it for academic purposes, he or she should refer back to the original source.

<p class="indent">    
It is difficult to say what determines whether one is a Wikipedia editor, but I believe that a thorough understanding, although difficult, of the different standards that are used to review Wikipedia pages is necessary for one to ensure that he or she is following the guidelines before making recommendations on whether a page should be deleted. 
<p/>
    
    
<p class="indent">    
To maintain its current function, I believe that Wikipedia should still be kept a space for anyone to add additional content to a page, but there should be some sort of official review by professional Wikipedia experts that have years of experience working on the platform to ensure that the content is legible, relevant, and accurate before it is published to the public. This goes onto my next point - I think Wikipedia should offer certain expert users an opportunity to work for the platform, reviewing new content added to the platform to ensure that the content isn’t entirely irrelevant and meaningless to the audience. Wikipedia does not necessarily need to get more editors, but it should aim to increase the number of experienced editors, thereby improving the quality of the content displayed on the platform.
